# ONT-nonb-GoFAE-COD
Goodness-of-fit contrastive autoencoder for outlier detection of non-B DNA in ONT sequencing.





## Prepare the input:

### Step 1:
Extract motifs postions from non B DNA DB.

### Step 2: 
Fix windows of length x around motifs.

### Step 3: 
Extend the positions on the opposite strand.

### Step 4: 
Find high quality reads that fall on the windows.

### Step 5:
Find motif free regions.

### Step 6:
Compute translocation signal on the non-overlapping windows.






Abstract:
Non-canonical (or non-B) DNA are genomic regions where the three-dimensional conformation of DNA deviates from the double helical structure.
Non-B DNA play an important role in basic cellular processes and have been associated with genomic instability, gene regulation, and oncogenesis.
